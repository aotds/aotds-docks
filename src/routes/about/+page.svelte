  The Docks is a ship builder for the game
  <a href="https://shop.groundzerogames.co.uk/rules.html" class="helper"
    >Full Thrust</a
  >, with construction rules following the
  <a href="http://members.ozemail.com.au/~laranzu/fullthrust/rules/">
    Cross Dimensions rules
  </a>
  as closely as possible.

<p>
  The app is mostly developed for Firefox. I also check as much as I can that I
  don't mess things too badly on Chrome. For the other browsers... caveat
  emptor.
